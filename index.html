        <h6 class="line_titles"></h6>
        <p class="how-it-works-paragraph">Acupuncture is the method of using tiny, hair-thin needles to regulate the flow of your body’s vital energy, also called&nbsp;<strong>qi</strong>. Like blood, <strong>qi</strong> flows in invisible vessels called&nbsp;<strong>acupuncture meridians or channels</strong>. The needles are placed in specific <strong>acupuncture points</strong>&nbsp;along those invisible lines of energy running beneath the surface of the skin.</p><img src="images/Logo.png" width="110">
        <p class="how-it-works-paragraph">Acupuncture stimulates the energy balance of the body and works to restore health.</p><a class="button know-more-fix" href="#" data-ix="showhide-how-it-works">Know More</a>
        <div class="hidden-know-more" data-ix="showhide-how-it-works">
          <div class="knowmore-howitworks">The true foundation of Chinese medicine is&nbsp;qi, which can be translated as life energy or life force. Through proper training, people can develop the sensitivity to feel the flow of qi. In the human body, qi flows through&nbsp;meridians, or energy pathways.&nbsp;
            <br>
            <br> A network of twelve major meridians run through the body allowing the qi to travels to the various organs and send messages to one another. For this reason, keeping the meridians clear is imperative for the body’s self-regulating actions to occur.&nbsp;
            <br>
            <br> Often, however, the qi that is supposed to run through these meridians becomes blocked. When this happens, qi can stagnate, leading to minor ailments, such as aches, digestive and sleep problems, or fatigue. It’s analogous to a traffic jam: since the streets are backed up, it takes longer for information and energy to travel from one point to another, so the body becomes sluggish and pain can be felt.&nbsp;
            <br>
            <br> Acupuncture helps restore the flow of qi along the meridians to relieve pain and restore health. It&nbsp;also emphasizes the importance of self-help as part of treatment, involving patients in their own treatment and encouraging them to take control of their own health. Often treatment at a sufficiently early stage could prevent a mild discomfort from turning into a major illness.</div><a class="close-know-more" href="#" data-ix="close-know-more-fixed">X</a>

              <p class="tabs-paragrah">Traditional Chinese Medicine has a sophisticated approach to the understanding of pain. Pain itself is understood not as a singular instance but rather in relation to the overall health of the body. Some physical pain can be easily linked to stress and emotions or to an underlying health problem, so pain is not treated in isolation. &nbsp;Acupuncture can provide real relief from common forms of pain including:</p>

It can help you build your confidence, energy levels and balance your emotional and physical wellbeing.

          <p class="tabs-text-phone">Traditional Chinese Medicine has a sophisticated approach to the understanding of pain. Pain itself is understood not as a singular instance but rather in relation to the overall health of the body. Some physical pain can be easily linked to stress and emotions or to an underlying health problem, so pain is not treated in isolation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Acupuncture can provide real relief from common forms of pain including:</p>

Slipped discs in the spine can cause pain down the legs along the sciatic nerve, which travels the course of acupuncture meridians.&nbsp; Many people with acute or chronic pain on the back, shoulders, arms or legs find acupuncture helpful as it has a low risk of side effects and can help reduce the use of anti-inflammatory medication and painkillers. Acupuncture, by addressing the root cause, releases the tension and improves or completely eliminates the pain.</p>
